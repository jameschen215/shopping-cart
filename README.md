### How to change base font family in tailwindcss

  }
}
```

### Vitest + TypeScript Path Alias Issue in VSCode

**The Problem:**
Even though my tests using `@` alias (like `@/routes/layout`) worked with Vitest, VSCode still showed an error:

```lua
Cannot find module '@/routes/layout' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

This happened because VSCode's TypeScript language service does not automatically read `vite.config.ts` or project references in `tsconfig.json`. It only uses the closest `tsconfig` that includes the current file.

‚úÖ **The Solution**

1. Define path aliases in both tsconfig.json and tsconfig.app.json:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./src/*"]
  }
}
```

2. Make sure the test files are included in the active tsconfig:

   - Option A: Add `"test"` to the `include` array in `tsconfig.app.json`:

     ```json
     "include": ["src", "test"]
     ```

   - Option B (cleaner): Create a new `tsconfig.test.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "extends": "./tsconfig.app.json",
       "include": ["test"]
     }
     ```

     Then update your main tsconfig.json:

     ```json
     "references": [
        { "path": "./tsconfig.app.json" },
        { "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" },
        { "path": "./tsconfig.test.json" }
      ]
     ```

3. Restart TS Server in VSCode (`Ctrl + Shift + P` ‚Üí ‚ÄúTypeScript: Restart TS Server‚Äù)

### Image Fitting Inside a Fixed-Size Card (TailwindCSS)

**GOAL:** Make an image completely fill a fixed-size card:

- If there's space on the sides, the image should be full width.
- Otherwise, it should be full height.

**SOLUTION:** TailwindCSS + HTML Solution

```html
<div class="h-64 w-64 overflow-hidden">
  <img src="your-image.jpg" class="h-full w-full object-cover" />
</div>
```

### What does `end` mean in `<NavLink>`?

In React Router, the `end` prop tells the link to match exactly ‚Äî it‚Äôs like saying:

> ‚ÄúOnly mark this link as active if the current URL is exactly equal to the `to` prop.‚Äù

- If your URL is `/products/category/jewelry` without `end`, then this code - `<NavLink to="/products">` will be considered active, because `/products` is a prefix of `/products/category/jewelry`.

- If your URL is `/products` with `end` - `<NavLink to="/products" end={to === '/products'}>`. Now it only matches `/products` exactly, and won't be active for `/products/category/...`.

When to use end?
‚úÖ Use it for parent routes like `/products`, `/settings`, etc.

‚ùå Don‚Äôt use it when you want the link to stay active for subroutes.

### How to make shadcn/ui NavigationMenu take up the full width of its parent?

Use arbitrary properties from Tailwindcss - `<NavigationMenu className="w-full [&>div]:!w-full">` to override the `div` with inline-style from `NavigationMenuList`, which is `<div style='position: relative'>...</div>`:

```tsx
<NavigationMenu
  aria-label="Category navigation"
  className="w-full max-w-full [&>div]:!w-full"
>
  <NavigationMenuList className="flex w-full justify-between">
    {CATEGORIES.map(({ id, label, to }) => (
      <NavigationMenuItem key={id}>
        <NavLink to={to} end={to === "/products"}>
          {({ isActive }) => (
            <NavigationMenuLink
              asChild
              className={cn(
                "capitalize hover:bg-transparent hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4",
                isActive && "underline underline-offset-4",
              )}
            >
              <span>{label}</span>
            </NavigationMenuLink>
          )}
        </NavLink>
      </NavigationMenuItem>
    ))}
  </NavigationMenuList>
</NavigationMenu>
```

### Handling Redirects in Toast Actions (shadcn/ui + React Router)

- **Problem:**
  The redirect() function didn't work when used inside a toast action callback.

- **Why:**
  redirect() is meant for use in React Router loaders or actions ‚Äî not inside client-side event handlers.

- **Solution:**
  Use useNavigate() from React Router to imperatively navigate in event handlers instead.

- **Working Example:**

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const navigate = useNavigate();

toast.success("Item has been added to your cart.", {
  action: {
    label: "Go to Cart",
    onClick: () => navigate("/cart"),
  },
});
```

- **Bonus:**
  This makes your app feel more dynamic and user-friendly. üî•
